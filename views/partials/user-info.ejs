    <p class="dialog-info">The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to
      classify underweight, overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the
      square of the height in meters. While BMI does not measure body fat directly, research has shown, that BMI
      correlates to direct measures of body fat. The standard weight status categories shown above are associated with
      BMI for adults 20 years of age and older.</p>

  <dialog id="rmr-info">
    <p class="dialog-info">The Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) is the energy you expend while at rest (in Calories per
      day). Its actual value depends upon a number of factors including age, sex, body weight, and individual genetic
      factors. We ignore the genetic factors and use a simplified approach to estimating your RMR based upon your age,
      sex, and body weight. Besides RMR, there is also a term basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is something different
      than resting metabolic rate. BMR measurements are more strict than those of RMR â€“ the BMR test requires a 24-hour
      rest and an overnight fast, while the RMR needs only a 15-minute relaxation period.</p>
    <p class="dialog-info">The BMR doesn't take into account, e.g., calories utilized for food digestion. That's the
      reason why RMR is considered to be more reliable in the estimation of resting calories. Your body is usually
      digesting some amount of food at every moment of time.</p>

      it is a slightly different formula. It is the daily energy needed to sustain cell metabolism and associated life

      is something different than BMR. BMR measurements are more strict than those of RMR - the BMR test requires a
